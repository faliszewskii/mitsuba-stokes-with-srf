Mitsuba renderer reproducer project for testing stokes integrator plugin compatibility with specfilm plugin. 

Running:
```
python main.py
```

Currently rendering the scene produces an error:
```
Dr.Jit encountered an unrecoverable error and will now shut
down. Please re-run your program in debug mode to check for
out-of-bounds reads, writes, and other sources of undefined
behavior. You can do so by calling

   dr.set_flag(dr.JitFlag.Debug, True)

at the beginning of the program. If these additional checks
fail to pinpoint the problem, then you have likely found a
bug. We are happy to help investigate and fix the problem if
you can you create a self-contained reproducer and submit it
at https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/drjit.

The error message of this specific failure is as follows:
>>> Referenced an unknown variable a327!
Aborted (core dumped)
```
